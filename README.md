# Buy, sell, and transfer bitcoin using Block.io API and Laravel

This is a prototype of a modern Crypto Exchange. It was borne out of a challenge to create one when I saw none online. 

I had always been fascinated by the inner workings of a blockchain API and this project was a refresher in that regards. 

It boasts of a few lightweight features common in most online crypto currency exchanges. The transactions on this script are basically bitcoin based. 

The installation is simple. It follows the installation process of other laravel scripts. 

It is still a work in progress and hopefully it matures into something robust enough to be used in large scale production.
